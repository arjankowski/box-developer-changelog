# Marker-based Pagination Support for Users API

The [Users API](e://get_users) now supports [marker-based
pagination](g://api-calls/pagination/marker-based). Marker-based pagination is
an alternative to regular offset-based pagination and provides an alternative
way to get users for enterprises with a large volume of users.
