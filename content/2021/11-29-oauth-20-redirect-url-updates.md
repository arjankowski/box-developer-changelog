#  OAuth 2.0 Redirect URL Updates

About titles: good titles are less than 50 characters,
explain what changed, and follow previous similar entries. For example:

<!-- more -->

Everything behind this comment is hidden by default if the `collapse` value in the frontmatter is set to `true` and `show_excerpt` is also set to `true`.

Start with a small section that explains in basic terms what has changed
and how this impacts a customers. Make sure to add to related content, for
example:

## Updates

Remove this section if there are no new updates in this release. Provides a list
of updates in this release that are not bug fixes or new features. Each entry in this 
list should start with a verb.

* Updated the `redirect_url` query parameter wordings on the [`GET /authorize`][authorize] endpoint page
*
