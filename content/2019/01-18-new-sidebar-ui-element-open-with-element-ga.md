Two major releases have been made to the Box UI Elements:

1. New Sidebar Element: This new element provides capabilities for
incorporating the metadata sidebar for a file directly into your own
application or website. Documentation is available
[here](guides://embed/ui-elements).
2. GA of Open With Element: The Open With element has been moved from beta to
general availability. Open With delivers an individual button or an integration
into the existing Content Explorer element to launch file content with Adobe
Sign, G Suite, or Box Edit. Documentation is available
[here](guides://embed/ui-elements).

Full release announcement is available [here][blog_new_element].
